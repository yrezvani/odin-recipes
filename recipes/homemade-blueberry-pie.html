    <h3>Top-rated blueberry recipe</h3>
    <p>Blueberry pie is readily made because it does not require pitting or peeling of fruit. It usually has a top and bottom crust. The top crust can be circular, but the pie can also have a crumble crust or no top crust. Blueberry pies are often eaten in the summertime when blueberries are in season in the Northern hemisphere.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 cups fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set an oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; sprinkle over blueberries.</li>
        <li>Line a pie dish with one pie crust. Pour berry mixture into the crust and dot with butter. Cut remaining pastry into 1/2- to 3/4-inch-wide strips. Use the strips to weave a lattice top. Crimp and flute the edges.</li>
